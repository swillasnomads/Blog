## Post 15: Final Australian City

For our last stop in Australia we were lucky enough to be hosted by Melbourneâ€™s newest residents, Hill and Riggs, friends of ours from Toronto working from Melbourne for the next year (and possibly more - itâ€™s an ongoing debate ðŸ˜…).

Melbourne is another incredibly vibrant city. We had an absolute blast visiting and playing tourist. We went to see an Aussie Rules Football game which was incredibly entertaining. The game is really fast paced and definitely a little bit confusing. Hectic might be a better word for it but worth every penny.

We had a lovely picnic in our favourite botanical garden to date (sorry Brisbane and Sydney). They had a whole section dedicated to ferns and another to camellia sinensis (the plant used to make tea!).

But truly the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance was the wine tour. A huge thank you to Hill for organizing, it was the best wine tour Iâ€™ve ever been on. We hit up 4 wineries, each of which was serving us 5-7 wines to taste, with one full glass with lunch. We truly did not need more wine, but Riggs wasnâ€™t drinking, so we had more than our fair share. And the whole day took place with a picturesque fall background. We couldnâ€™t have asked for a better day.

Our time in Melbourne came to a close with an exploratory day of the city. We hit up the free museum exhibits, had a wonderful lunch on the canal, toured the university grounds and fit in a covid test for our upcoming flights to New Zealand (we were negative - woo!).

We would honestly recommend every thing that we did in Melbourne - especially the wine tour. 

##### Special call outs to where we went out for food: 
* **Rococo** - Incredible pizza and even better superfood salad
* **Frankieâ€™s** - Lovely brunch spot, I would highly recommend their chai

* **Arbory Afloat** - The fresh flat bread was to die for ðŸ¤¤
