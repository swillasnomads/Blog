## Post 22: Biarritz Baby 🏄🏼‍♀️ 🏄🏽‍♂️ 

We made it to Biarritz. The place I’d been dreaming about since I visited in July 2017 and promised myself all those years ago, that I would come back, for longer than a week and learn to surf. I find this town magical, a perfect juxtaposition of beautiful, rich architecture with nomadic surfers.

The plan was to settle in Biarritz for 3 months (essentially the whole summer). However, when we started looking for an apartment in October of last year, we quickly realized we couldn’t afford 3 months. The prices spike in July and August here. Our airbnb quadrupled its price starting in mid july. Thus, we booked 6 weeks. And within one week of being in our perfect airbnb, and falling in love with the city all over again, we booked an additional 10 days (in a different spot).

We’re very lucky, the space we have is spacious, incredibly bright, a massive outdoor space with a view of the ocean. It makes even the rainiest days pleasurable.

Will finally has the space (both mental and physical) to work on his French. He’s getting quite good.

We’re eating way too much cheese and bread. Essentially trying out every bakery’s baguette.

We arrived in Biarritz on June 1st, too early to check into the airbnb, so we settled into a cafe for the morning and explored the coast in the evening.

By the end of June 2nd, we were the proud owners of surf boards and wetsuits! Some would say it was an impulsive decision, and they would be right, but that didn’t dim our happiness. That same afternoon we hit a lake like ocean with our surf boards to practice paddling on them and getting accustomed to the “intermediate boards” we had bought (even though we’re very squarely beginners) 🏄🏽‍♂️ 🏄🏼‍♀️.

I joked that being the only people in the water with surfboards for two days straight worked on my humility. 

The rest of the week, we ran errands, visited Bayonne (the nearest big city), surfed (poorly) and settled into our new home. No complaints here.
